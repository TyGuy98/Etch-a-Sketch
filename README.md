# Etch-a-Sketch

This was a very fun and challenging project to take on. I definitely had to refer to Google when I got stuck at some parts.
The most challenging part was getting the grid to stay together once the user resized the grid or changed the window size.
Another challenging part was stopping the lag when the squares changed colour. Utilising event delegation helped to solve
this.

Skills learnt:
- Using different event listeners (mouseenter, change, click)
- Event delegation
- Getting a random RGB colour 
- Looping through the children of an element 
- Opacity CSS property to darken the squares
- Created a select element to allow user to change colour
- Aspect ratio to keep the divs square
